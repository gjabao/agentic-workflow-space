# MASSIVE Re-Enrichment in Progress

## Scope

Processing ALL unique businesses from comprehensive master databases:

### Calgary
- **Input**: 341 unique businesses
- **Status**: Google Maps scraping in progress
- **Output File**: Calgary_ALL_341_Businesses_ENRICHED.csv

### Edmonton  
- **Input**: 158 unique businesses
- **Status**: Google Maps scraping COMPLETE (154 results found)
- **Currently**: Enriching emails with AnyMailFinder
- **Output File**: Edmonton_ALL_158_Businesses_ENRICHED.csv

## Total Scope

**499 unique businesses** being re-enriched to find additional emails!

## Why This Is Massive

The original documents showed:
- Calgary: 400+ rows (many businesses already had multiple emails)
- Edmonton: 170+ rows (many businesses already had multiple emails)

By extracting UNIQUE businesses and re-enriching ALL of them:
1. Find additional emails missed in previous enrichment
2. Consolidate all email discovery in one comprehensive enrichment
3. Create master databases with ALL possible emails for each business

## Expected Results

Based on previous enrichment rates (~200% email discovery):
- Calgary 341 businesses → Estimated 600-900 contact rows
- Edmonton 158 businesses → Estimated 300-450 contact rows
- **Total: 900-1,350 contact rows** from 499 businesses

## Processing Time

With 499 businesses:
- Google Maps batch lookup: ~3-5 minutes (DONE for Edmonton, in progress for Calgary)
- Email enrichment: ~45-90 minutes for all businesses
- Expected completion: Within 1-2 hours

Both processes running in PARALLEL for maximum speed!
