# Cold Email Copywriting Skill

Write high-converting cold emails using proven frameworks: **Anti-Fragile Method** (AI-powered personalization), **Connector Angle** (helpful introducer positioning), and **SSM Connector Method** (status/signal/market positioning).

## Three Core Methods

### Method 1: Anti-Fragile Method
AI fills in personalized variables within human-written templates. Best for scaling personalized outreach.

**When to use:** Sending 50+ emails with similar structure but personalized details.

### Method 2: Connector Angle  
Position as someone making helpful introductions, not selling directly. Gets 2-3x better reply rates than direct pitches.

**When to use:** Want simple, proven approach with 15-20% reply rates.

### Method 3: SSM Connector Method
Advanced framework combining Status/Signal/Market positioning with 5 premium opener families. Gets 3-5x better reply rates.

**When to use:** Premium positioning, high-value prospects, competing against other agencies, need 20-30%+ reply rates.

**For complete SSM workflow:** See `references/ssm-connector-guide.md`

## Quick Start Guide

### Choose Your Method

**Start with Anti-Fragile if:**
- Scaling to 100+ emails
- Have clear variables to personalize
- Want AI to fill in specific blanks

**Start with Connector Angle if:**
- First time with cold email
- Want proven simple approach
- 15-20% reply rates acceptable

**Start with SSM Connector if:**
- Want premium positioning
- Targeting high-value prospects
- Ready to back claims with research
- Need 20-30%+ reply rates

## Anti-Fragile Method Workflow

### Step 1: Write Your Dream Email (to ONE real person)

Pick one real prospect and craft a perfect, personalized email showing you researched them.

**Dream Email Structure (5-7 sentences, <100 words):**

1. **Line 1:** Personalized opener showing you looked them up
2. **Lines 2-3:** Describe their current situation/problem
3. **Lines 4-5:** Your specific solution and outcome
4. **Line 6:** Easy, low-commitment CTA

**Rules for Dream Email:**
- Keep it short (5-7 sentences max, under 100 words)
- Lead with THEM, not you
- No jargon or corporate speak
- Be specific, not generic
- One clear outcome
- Easy CTA (gauge interest, don't demand meeting)

**Example Dream Email:**
```
Hey Brook — saw you're hiring a Sales Rep.

I work with a recruiter who just placed a top rep in a similar space using direct headhunting (no job boards, no fluff).

We do all the heavy lifting — shortlisting only 3–5 sales pros who are already hitting quota in your niche.

If we can't deliver a solid candidate in 7–10 days, no worries.

Worth a quick chat?
```

### Step 2: Identify Variables

Review your dream email and identify parts that would change for different companies. Convert these into variables.

**Common Variables:**
- `{{firstName}}` - Recipient's first name
- `{{companyName}}` - Company name
- `{{industry}}` - Industry/niche (2-3 casual words)
- `{{pain_point}}` - Specific problem they face
- `{{relevant_observation}}` - Recent company activity/news
- `{{current_method}}` - How they currently get clients
- `{{outcome}}` - Specific result they'd get

### Step 3: Create AI Prompts for Each Variable

For EVERY variable, create a dedicated AI prompt using this 5-part structure:

1. **Task:** Clear one-sentence job for AI
2. **Input:** Provide company data
3. **Examples:** 3-5 perfect output examples
4. **Rules:** 3-7 strict rules to prevent hallucination
5. **Output Format:** Specify exactly what you want back

See `references/variable-prompts.md` for complete, ready-to-use prompts for all variables.

**Critical Rules for AI Prompts:**
- Give AI one job at a time
- Provide clear examples of desired output
- Set hard rules to prevent AI going "off the rails"
- Specify output formats for precision
- Always include: "Only use info from input. If not found, say 'insufficient data.' Do not guess."

### Step 4: Generate Variables & Combine

1. Run each variable prompt separately with company data
2. Review outputs for quality (read out loud - does it sound human?)
3. Plug all outputs into your template
4. Human review first 3-5 before scaling

## Connector Angle Method

### What Is It?

Instead of directly pitching your service, offer to introduce the prospect to someone who solved their problem. That "someone" is you or your client.

**Example:**
- ❌ Direct: "I run ads, hire me."
- ✅ Connector: "I spoke to a founder last week who scaled past $300K/month after breaking their ad plateau. If you're dealing with inconsistent performance, I'm happy to intro you."

### Why It Works

- **Low resistance** - Not asking for a sale, just offering value
- **Trusted position** - You're a helpful middleman, not a salesperson
- **Sparks curiosity** - They wonder "who is this person?"
- **Higher reply rates** - 2-3x better than direct pitches

### Four Connector Angles

1. **Problem Solving:** Connect them to someone who solves their pain
2. **Relevance:** Introduce someone who helped a similar company
3. **Innovation:** Share something cutting-edge
4. **Opportunity:** Highlight unique benefit

### Connector Email Structure

**Basic Template:**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

{{relevant_observation}}

{{describe_their_current_situation}}

I know someone who {{specific_outcome}} for {{similar_company}}.

Want me to intro you?
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Katie,

Saw Blue Star Donuts doing solid work in restaurants.

I know a team that helped a bakery chain get 40-50% of their revenue from email in 60 days — same traffic, just smarter automation.

Worth exploring?
```

### The Reveal (When They Say Yes)

When prospect replies positively, you have two options:

**Option 1: Self-Loop**
```
Hey, awesome. That's actually me. I run a boutique sales systems agency focused on this exact setup. 

[Brief case study or result]

Want to jump on a quick call to see if it's a fit?
```

**Option 2: Mini Authority Play**
```
Great, you're in luck. That's actually my thing. I run a growth studio that helps companies like yours [specific outcome].

Just helped [Company] achieve [Result] in [Timeframe].

Should we chat this week?
```

### Handling Common Responses

**If they say "Yes, connect me":**
- Book a 10-minute call first to "map out exactly what you're looking for"
- This positions you as organized, buys time for research, maintains professionalism

**If they say "Tell me more":**
- Provide a quick one-pager/case study
- Then ask: "Does this sound relevant? Happy to intro if so."
- Never push - keep it casual

**If they ask "Who are you?":**
- "I just know a bunch of folks in the industry. Figured this might help. Let me know if you'd prefer I don't reach out again."

**If they go dark:**
- Follow up 2-3 days later
- Then gracefully close the loop if no reply

## SSM Connector Method (Advanced)

**For complete workflow, templates, and examples:** See `references/ssm-connector-guide.md`

### Core Concept

SSM combines:
- **S**tatus positioning (high-value insider energy)
- **S**ignal detection (market intel, movement, access)
- **M**arket conversation (what you're hearing from prospects)

With **5 Premium Opener Families** creating different energy levels.

### Quick Reference

**6 SSM Prompts:**
1. Company-Based Insight
2. Market Conversation Insight  
3. Daily Presence
4. Deal-Flow
5. Ultra-Operator (highest status)
6. Premium Signal

**5 Opener Families:**
1. "Been mapping some signals lately" (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ status)
2. "Saw some movement on my side" (⭐⭐⭐⭐ deal flow)
3. "Your name came up on my end" (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ exclusive)
4. "Been curating a few matches this week" (⭐⭐⭐⭐ selective)
5. "Got a signal that fits you" (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ premium)

### SSM Email Structure

```
[OPENER FAMILY] —
[Market insight/pain point]
[What separates good from bad approaches]
[Proof point - specific outcome]
[Easy CTA]
Sent from my iPhone
```

### Example

```
Saw some movement on my side —

I'm around CTOs at DeFi protocols and they keep saying they waste 90+ days 
filtering junior devs when they need senior Solidity engineers who've 
actually deployed to mainnet

Most recruiters send resume spam. Best teams use direct headhunting for 
pre-vetted senior talent only

We placed 3 blockchain engineers for protocols like yours last quarter — 
each with 5+ years shipping real products

Worth exploring

Sent from my iPhone
```

### 4 Critical Rules

1. **Never switch energy** - Don't go from high-status to desperate
2. **Rotate openers** - Use different family each email
3. **Back claims with research** - No vague statements
4. **Keep it specific** - Not generic

**For detailed guide:** See `references/ssm-connector-guide.md`

## Follow-Up Sequences

### 4-Touch Follow-Up Sequence

**Follow-up 1 (Day 2-4 - "Resurfacing"):**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

Quick follow-up in case my last note got buried.

{{re-anchor_the_value}}

Totally up to you.
```

**Follow-up 2 (Day 9-11 - "Timing Flexibility"):**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

No stress if now's not the time.

{{mention_how_others_got_value}}

Happy to circle back later if that works better?
```

**Follow-up 3 (Day 12 - "Breakup"):**
```
Hey {{firstName}},

Totally understand if this isn't a priority right now.

Won't bug you again, but happy to connect if it ever makes sense.

Wishing {{companyName}} continued wins 🙏
```

### Core Principles for Follow-Ups

- **Low-pressure tone** - "It's totally up to you" energy
- **Assume inbox chaos** - Gentle check-in
- **Reference value, not yourself** - Why the intro helps THEM
- **Strategic touches** - Soft nudge → back off → breakup

---

## Offer Positioning Framework

Your offer isn't just what you deliver - it's how you position yourself in the prospect's mind.

### The Magician Archetype

Position yourself as a **magician** (transforms lives), not a **vendor** (sells stuff). Vendors get price objections. Magicians get credit cards.

### Sell Outcome, Not Process

- ❌ "Cold email campaigns"
- ✅ "Become the business owner who has clients calling them"

### Never Mention Refunds/Guarantees

Saying "money-back guarantee" plants doubt. Instead, use risk-reversal:
- "We handle everything so you only pay once results are live"
- "If you don't see X in 30 days, we'll do Y until you do"

### Simple Offer Formula

```
I work with [specific niche] to become [desired identity] by [specific outcome] in [timeframe].

This is what happens when [type of business] works with me.
```

**Examples:**
- "I help recruitment agencies become the go-to firm in their city by securing 5 new corporate clients in 60 days. This is what happens when serious agencies work with me."
- "I help medical practices become fully booked by adding 20 new patients monthly within 45 days. This is what happens when ambitious practices work with me."

## Email Writing Rules

### Core Principles

1. **Keep it short** - 5-7 sentences max, under 100 words
2. **Lead with them** - First sentence about them, not you
3. **No jargon** - Write like a human conversation
4. **Be specific** - State your niche and offer clearly
5. **One outcome** - Focus on benefits, not features
6. **Easy CTA** - Low-friction, gauge interest

### CRITICAL: Spartan/Laconic Tone Rules

**Always follow these rules for every email:**

1. **Spartan/Laconic tone** - Short, simple, direct. No fluff.
2. **Keep it formal but brief** - Professional without being corporate
3. **No punctuation at the end** - Drop periods at end of sentences/CTAs
4. **Imply familiarity** - Show you share the same beliefs, interests, or goals whenever possible
5. **Shorten company names** - Use "XYZ" instead of "XYZ Agency", "Love AMS" instead of "Love AMS Professional Services"
6. **Simple language only** - Avoid corporate jargon, buzzwords, fancy words
7. **Focus on WHAT, not HOW** - What they do, not how they do it
8. **Use lowercase strategically** - For casual sections while keeping formality

### Formatting Standards

- **No punctuation at end of sentences** - "Worth exploring" not "Worth exploring?"
- Add "Sent from my iPhone" at the bottom (makes it feel personal)
- Use {{variables}} for personalization
- Keep paragraphs 1-2 sentences max
- Shorten company names wherever natural

### Voice & Tone

- **Spartan, not wordy** - "Figured I'd reach out" not "I am reaching out to inform you"
- **Confident, not desperate** - "Worth exploring" not "Please let me know if you're interested"
- **Helpful, not pushy** - "Happy to intro" not "You should definitely talk to this person"
- **Familiar, not distant** - Imply shared beliefs/interests when relevant
- **Direct, not robotic** - "Quick question" not "I am writing to inquire"

### Examples of Spartan Tone

**❌ Too wordy:**
"I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out because I noticed that your company..."

**✅ Spartan:**
"Saw XYZ is scaling fast"

**❌ Corporate jargon:**
"We leverage cutting-edge methodologies to optimize your pipeline"

**✅ Simple language:**
"We help you get more qualified calls"

**❌ With punctuation:**
"Worth exploring?"

**✅ No punctuation:**
"Worth exploring"

**❌ Full company name:**
"Love what ABC Professional Services is doing"

**✅ Shortened:**
"Love what ABC is doing"

**❌ Explaining HOW:**
"We use a proprietary 7-step system to identify and engage prospects"

**✅ Focus on WHAT:**
"We connect you with companies actively hiring"
