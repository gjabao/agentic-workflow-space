# Connector Sales Script Generator

## Objective
Generate a bespoke **Connector Sales Script** based on any input document (business context, offer details, ICP, pricing). The script must strictly adhere to the "Connector/Operator" methodology: **Gatekeeper positioning, "Noise to Timing," and "Filter not Vendor."**

---

## 🧠 The Mental Frame (Before You Start)
*   **The Internal Script**: "I don’t need this deal. I’m here to see if *they* are worth working with."
*   **The Identity**: You are not a lead gen agency. You are not a vendor. You are a **Gatekeeper**. You control access to capital/talent/growth moments.
*   **The Goal**: Move from **Noise** ("I want more clients") → **Timing** ("something broke") → **Loss** ("if I don't fix this, I lose X").

## 📝 Inputs Required
To generate the script, extract or define the following from the context:
1.  **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**: Who are they selling to? (e.g., "Series A-C Tech", "7-figure E-com").
2.  **The "Trigger"**: What usually causes their clients to buy? (e.g., "Funding", "Hiring Spikes", "Regulation Change").
3.  **The Offer**: What is the "Window" being opened? (e.g., "90-day pilot", "Exclusive Sourcing").
4.  **Pricing**: The "Gate Fee" (e.g., $5k, $8k).
5.  **The "Golden Result"**: What is one successful client worth to them? (ROI Anchor).

## 🗣️ The Script Structure

### Phase 1: The Opening (Traffic Control)
**Goal:** Stop the "Vendor Pitch" frame immediately. Establish equal status.
**Timing:** Max 90 seconds.

**The Opener:**
"Hey [Name], appreciate you hopping on. Just to set expectations real quick — I'm not here to pitch you anything. I'm trying to understand your world first to see if it even makes sense for me to connect you with [ICP Segment]. Fair?"

**If they ask "Do you know people?":**
"Good question. Some, yes. Most, I filter for. But before we get there — I need to understand your operation first so I don’t waste your time."

**The First Question (Immediate Control):**
"Let me flip this around. What type of placements/clients make you the most money and are the least painful for you to fill?"

### Phase 2: Discovery (Noise to Timing)
**Goal:** Turn "wishes" into "causes." Find the **Structural Pain**.

**1. The "Golden Question" (ROI Anchor):**
"Which of those customers are the easiest to work with AND make you the most money?"
*(Let them answer)*
"Roughly what’s one of those worth to you over a year?"
*(Anchor: "So even 2-3 of those is meaningful.")*

**2. The "Capacity" Check:**
"Out of the clients you have now, are you at capacity, or could you comfortably handle 5-10 more of the *right* ones?"

**3. The "Hard No" (Filter Test):**
"Let me make sure I don't waste your time. What’s a [ICP] that would be a HARD NO for you — even if they wanted to pay you?"
*(This proves you are a filter, not a dumper).*

**4. The "Urgency" Probe (Noise -> Timing):**
"You mentioned you want more [ICP]. Everyone wants more. What changed in the last 30 days that made you actually take this call? Why not just wait until next quarter?"
*(Force them to admit: "We hired staff," "We're bleeding," "We missed targets.")*

**5. The Consequence (Future Pace):**
"If you *don't* solve this in the next 90 days — if you stay at [Current State] — what actually breaks?"

### Phase 3: The Pivot (Diagnosis)
**Goal:** Diagnosis before Prediction. Reframe their problem as a **Timing/Leverage** problem.

**The Transition:**
"I’m going to pause you for a second — because I'm seeing a familiar setup here."

**The Reframe:**
"The issue isn't that you need 'leads.' It's that usually, you're meeting these companies *after* they've already started looking, or you're getting random volume instead of fit.
What you're describing is a **timing problem**."

**The Connector Value Prop:**
"My job isn't to bring you volume. It's to catch companies at the exact moment a [Trigger Event: Hiring/Funding/etc.] happens, filter them against your 'Hard No' list, and only introduce the ones that are ready to move."

### Phase 4: The Solution (The Window)
**Goal:** Sell **Access**, not Service.

**The Check:**
"If instead of 20 random leads, you spoke to fewer companies — but ones that were already showing [Trigger Signal] — would that be more valuable to you?"

**The Offer (The 90-Day Window):**
"Okay. Here’s how we’d work.
I don’t do 'pay per lead' or generic lists.
I open a **90-day window**.
During that window, my system tracks [Signals]. When a company hits that signal and matches your ICP, I position the intro.
If they don't match, you don't see them.
The fee to open that window is [Price/Gate Fee]."

### Phase 5: Handling The "Auditor" (Objections)
**Goal:** Collapse indecision. Maintain frame.

**Objection: "Can I see a list / Do you have them now?"**
**Response:** "I don’t have a static Rolodex sitting there. That’s selling noise. I have a *sourcing system* that filters the market. I only introduce when the fit is confirmed. The value isn't a list; it's that I keep the wrong people away from you."

**Objection: "Why the upfront fee? Can we do commission?"**
**Response:** "[Price] isn't an expense for output. It’s a filter for time. It moves this into motion. Without it, this waits. Based on what you told me, waiting is costing you [Reference Pain]. So do you want to move now, or wait?"

**Objection: "I need to think about it."**
**Response:** "Totally fair. Usually, that means one of two things: either the timing isn't urgent (which is fine), or the structure isn't clear. Which one is it? Because if it’s urgency, we should just pause and reconnect next quarter."

**Objection: "Can we do a trial / one intro?"**
**Response:** "I don't do 'one intro' trials. One data point tells us nothing. This works because it's a system. You either trust the logic of the filter, or you don't. If you don't, we shouldn't do it."

### Phase 6: The Close (Permission-Based)
**Goal:** Binary decision.

**The Summary:**
"So to recap: You need to fill capacity because [Pain]. You want [ICP] but keep getting noise.
We can open the window for 90 days for [Price] to target exactly those [Trigger] moments."

**The Question:**
"From what we discussed, does this feel like a logical next step to solve [Pain], or do you see a reason it wouldn't work?"

**If Yes:**
"Perfect. I’ll send the invoice/agreement now. We can onboard tomorrow. Fair?"

## 🚀 Execution Instructions
When generating a script for a specific user:
1.  **Read the Context**: Identify their specific ICP, Pain, and Triggers.
2.  **Fill the Variables**: Replace `[ICP]`, `[Trigger]`, `[Price]`, etc., with their real data.
3.  **Tone Check**: Ensure every sentence sounds like a **Peer/Consultant**, not a salesman. Remove exclamation marks. Use short sentences.
