## Philosophy

**"No value, no talk"**
- Touch 1: SEND ACTUAL INTROS (not demos, not examples - DO IT)
- Touch 2-4: Show process, build trust, share results
- Touch 5: ASK for call (only after massive value given)

**Reciprocity maxed out:**
- Free intros (5-10 total) = hours of work = massive obligation to reciprocate

**Energy protection:**
- If no engagement by Touch 3 → Stop after Touch 5
- Don't chase low-intent leads
