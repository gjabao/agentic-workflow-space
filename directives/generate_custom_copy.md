# Custom Cold Email Copy Generator

## Objective
Automatically generate high-converting cold email copy using **Anti-Fragile Method + Connector Angle** frameworks by analyzing client websites, researching competitors, identifying ICP pain points, and producing 3+ email variants with follow-ups optimized for 15-25% reply rates (vs 6-10% for generic emails).

---

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Anti-Fragile Method

**What It Is:** AI fills personalized variables within human-written templates. AI is bad at writing full emails but excellent at filling specific blanks.

**4-Step Process:**
1. **Write dream email** for one real prospect (5-7 sentences, <100 words)
2. **Identify variables** ({{firstName}}, {{companyName}}, {{industry}}, {{pain_point}}, etc.)
3. **Create AI prompts** for each variable using 5-part structure:
   - Task: Clear one-sentence job
   - Input: Provide company data
   - Examples: 3-5 perfect outputs
   - Rules: 3-7 strict rules to prevent hallucination
   - Output Format: Specify exactly what you want
4. **Generate & combine** outputs into template

**Critical Rule:** Give AI one job at a time. Always include: "Only use info from input. If not found, say 'insufficient data.' Do not guess."

---

### 2. Connector Angle

**What It Is:** Position as helpful introducer, not seller. Instead of "I run ads, hire me" → "I know someone who helped [similar company] achieve [result]. Want me to intro you?"

**Why It Works:**
- **Low resistance** - Not asking for sale, just offering value
- **Trusted position** - You're helpful middleman, not salesperson
- **Sparks curiosity** - They wonder "who is this person?"
- **Higher reply rates** - 2-3x better than direct pitches
- **Benchmark:** 18-25% reply rates vs 6-10% for direct

**CRITICAL: Spam Filter Avoidance**

Modern spam filters are sophisticated. Avoid these trigger words/phrases that reduce deliverability:

**Financial/Money Terms (NEVER use):**

- "100% free," "additional income," "best price," "cash bonus," "double your income," "earn money," "extra cash," "fast cash," "financial freedom," "free money," "make money," "million dollars," "money back," "pure profit"

**Urgency/Pressure (NEVER use):**

- "act now," "call now," "click here," "do it today," "exclusive deal," "get it now," "limited time," "order now," "urgent," "while supplies last," "you are a winner"

**Marketing Jargon (AVOID):**

- "ad," "bargain," "bonus," "cheap," "credit card offers," "deal," "discount," "investment," "loans," "luxury," "mortgage rates," "offer," "pre-approved," "trial," "work from home"

**Suspicious Phrases (NEVER use):**

- "not spam," "no obligation," "no fees," "hidden charges," "passwords," "unsolicited," "bulk email"

**✅ Instead, use:**

- Natural, conversational language
- Specific outcomes with context ("15 qualified meetings" not "earn money")
- Connector positioning ("I know someone who..." avoids all spam patterns)

**Four Connector Angles:**
1. **Problem Solving:** Connect them to someone who solves their pain
2. **Relevance:** Introduce someone who helped similar company
3. **Innovation:** Share something cutting-edge
4. **Opportunity:** Highlight unique benefit

**The Reveal (When They Say Yes):**

Option 1 - Self-Loop:
```
Hey, awesome. That's actually me. I run [your company] focused on [specific outcome].
Just helped [Company] achieve [Result] in [Timeframe].
Want to jump on a quick call to see if it's a fit?
```

Option 2 - System Reveal:
```
Awesome. I'll set that up just so I can make sure I connect you to the right people.
Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call this week? I can walk you through how it works.
```

---

## Recruitment Agency Angles (Niche Specific)

Use these angles specifically when targeting recruitment/staffing agencies.

### 1. Capacity-Based Angle
**Best for:** Small-mid agencies
**Copy:** "Quick check — are your recruiters at capacity right now, or are there desks that could take on more job flow without it breaking things?"
**Why it works:** You're not selling leads, you're checking load.

### 2. Timing / Backlog Angle
**Copy:** "I’m seeing a few roles where hiring managers are frustrated with speed, not quality. Before I route anything, I wanted to sanity-check whether you’re even taking on new job orders this month."
**Why it works:** Signals demand without promising anything.

### 3. Underutilized Recruiter Angle
**Copy:** "A lot of agencies I speak with have strong recruiters who are underutilized between placements. I’m pressure-testing whether it makes sense to route a few conversations their way."
**Why it works:** Hits owner pain directly (paying salaries for idle staff).

### 4. Specialization Drift Angle
**Copy:** "Do you still actively take on {{role}} roles, or has that shifted recently? I’m trying not to misroute anything."
**Why it works:** Sounds administrative, not salesy. High reply rate.

### 5. Missed-Deal Recovery Angle
**Copy:** "I occasionally hear from companies that dropped an agency mid-search due to timing or communication, not results. When that happens, I’m careful about who I re-route to."
**Why it works:** Frames you as a protector of both sides.

### 6. Quiet Demand Angle
**Best for:** Experienced owners
**Copy:** "I don’t blast agencies. I usually wait until I see repeat demand for the same role before reaching out. That’s why I’m pinging now."
**Why it works:** Scarcity without theatrics.

### 7. Opt-Out Respect Angle
**Copy:** "If now’s not a good time or you’re not taking new clients, totally fine — I just want to avoid sending noise to the wrong partners."
**Why it works:** Disarms defensiveness immediately.

## CRITICAL: Spartan/Laconic Tone Rules

**MUST follow for EVERY email:**

1. **Spartan/Laconic tone** - Short, simple, direct. No fluff.
2. **Keep it formal but brief** - Professional without being corporate
3. **NO PUNCTUATION at end** - Drop periods/question marks at end of sentences/CTAs
4. **Imply familiarity** - Show you share same beliefs, interests, or goals
5. **Shorten company names** - "XYZ" not "XYZ Agency"
6. **Simple language ONLY** - Ban jargon: leverage, optimize, streamline, synergy, solutions, innovative, cutting-edge, robust, paradigm, scalable, ecosystem, disruptive, revolutionary
7. **Focus on WHAT not HOW** - What they do, not how they do it
8. **Use lowercase strategically** - For casual sections while keeping formality
9. **5-7 sentences max** - Under 100 words total
10. **Lead with THEM, not you** - First sentence about them
11. **OUTCOMES over TOOLS/SYSTEMS** - Always mention results/outcomes first, not the method/system/tool used to achieve them

---

## Email Writing Standards

### Structure (5-7 sentences, <100 words):

1. **Line 1:** Personalized opener showing you looked them up
2. **Lines 2-3:** Describe their current situation/problem
3. **Lines 4-5:** Your specific solution and outcome
4. **Line 6:** Easy, low-commitment CTA
5. **End:** "Sent from my iPhone"

### Connector Email Template:

```
Hey {{firstName}},

{{relevant_observation}}

{{describe_their_current_situation}}

I know someone who {{specific_outcome}} for {{similar_company}}.

Want me to intro you

Sent from my iPhone
```

### Examples of Spartan Tone:

**❌ Too wordy:**
"I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out because I noticed that your company..."

**✅ Spartan:**
"Saw XYZ is scaling fast"

**❌ Corporate jargon:**
"We leverage cutting-edge methodologies to optimize your pipeline"

**✅ Simple language:**
"We help you get more qualified calls"

**❌ With punctuation:**
"Worth exploring?"

**✅ No punctuation:**
"Worth exploring"

**❌ Tool/system focus:**
"I know a team that uses AI-powered outreach and automated systems to book meetings"

**✅ Outcome focus:**
"I know a team that books 10-15 qualified meetings per month — helped 30+ companies generate $2M in pipeline"

**❌ Method-heavy:**
"I know someone who uses pain-based targeting and multi-inbox infrastructure for lead generation"

**✅ Result-focused:**
"I know someone who gets 5-10 qualified meetings per month consistently — booked 847 meetings for 30+ companies"

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Client Analysis
1. **Extract client website content:**
   - Value proposition
   - Services/offerings
   - Target audience (ICP)
   - Unique selling points
   - Industry/niche
   - Key differentiators
   - Recent milestones/news

### Phase 2: Competitor Research
2. **Find 5-10 competitors** (via web search or manual)
3. **Analyze competitor positioning:**
   - Their offers/services
   - Messaging/positioning
   - Pain points addressed
   - Key differentiators
   - Case studies/results mentioned

### Phase 3: Pain Point Identification
4. **Synthesize ICP pain points** from:
   - Competitor messaging
   - Industry challenges
   - Client's differentiation gaps
   - Job postings (what problems need solving)
5. **Rank pain points** by severity/frequency
   - Focus on operator-level, specific problems
   - Not generic ("grow revenue") but tactical
   - Examples: "scaling outbound without burning domains", "finding qualified sales hires in tight market"

### Phase 4: Copy Generation

**Generate 3+ email variants** using:

**Frameworks:** Connector Angle + Anti-Fragile Method

**Email Angles to Use:**
- **Problem-Solving:** Address pain directly → offer connector intro
- **Opportunity:** Highlight what they're missing → show outcome
- **Authority:** Reference case study → position as expert
- **Connector Intro:** "I know someone who helped [similar company]..."
- **Referral Connector:** "I know a team that helps [niche] with [specific outcome]..."
- **Case Study Connector:** "Been watching [industry] companies and noticed most struggle with [pain]..."

**Structure per variant:**
- **Subject line:** Under 5 words, personalized or curiosity-driven
- **SSM opener:** "Noticed {{companyName}} {{observation}}" or "Saw you're {{current_activity}}"
- **Bridge:** 1-2 sentences connecting to their pain/opportunity
- **Specific outcome:** With numbers (e.g., "5-10 qualified calls per month")
- **Easy CTA:** Low-pressure, no punctuation ("Worth exploring" / "Want me to intro you")
- **Signature:** "Sent from my iPhone"

**Follow-ups:**
- Day 3: "Hey {{firstName}}, worth intro'ing you"
- Day 7: "Hey {{firstName}}, maybe this isn't something you're interested in — wishing you the best"

### Phase 5: Output
7. **Create markdown file** with:
   - Client overview
   - Competitor analysis (5-10 companies)
   - ICP pain points (ranked, 5-7 specific)
   - 3+ email variants (subjects + bodies + follow-ups)
   - Clear formatting for easy copy-paste

## The Opener Rotation Framework

**Why Rotate:** Even perfect personalization fails if the pattern becomes recognizable. Rotate the opener energy while keeping the core message identical.

### Five Opener Families (Ranked by Status):

1. **Cleanest, highest-status:**
   - "Been mapping some signals lately —"
   - Energy: I see the pull before others do

2. **Movement-based:**
   - "Saw some movement on my side —"
   - Energy: Deal flow is happening now

3. **Ultra-operator, minimal:**
   - "Your name came up on my end —"
   - Energy: You're being discussed in my network

4. **Exclusive, deal-flow coded:**
   - "Been curating a few matches this week —"
   - Energy: I'm selective about who I connect

5. **Most premium, least effort:**
   - "Got a signal that fits you —"
   - Energy: I have something, deciding whether to share

**How to Use:**
- Pick one opener family per campaign batch
- Rotate to new family every 2-4 weeks
- Keep the rest of the email identical
- Track reply rates by opener family

**Key Principle:** You rotate the opener line only. The spine stays consistent. The rotation matters because market fatigue sets in when the scent is identical.

---

## Connector Follow-Up Psychology

**Critical Rule:** You never switch energy. Ever.

From first touch → follow-up → close, maintain the exact same posture: calm, minimal, in-control, offering access — not needing anything.

**Why This Matters:**

If your opener says "I'm plugged into the pull," but your follow-up turns into:
- ❌ "Hey just checking in!!"
- ❌ "Bumping this to the top of your inbox!"
- ❌ "Did you get my email??"

...you instantly lose the frame.

**Psychology:** High-status people don't chase. Connectors don't need replies. Deal flow doesn't beg.

**Connector Follow-Up Sequence:**

**Follow-Up #1 (Day 3):**
```
Hey {{firstName}}, worth intro'ing you
```

**Follow-Up #2 (Day 7 - Final):**
```
Hey {{firstName}}, maybe this isn't something you're interested in — wishing you the best
```

**Tone Principles:**
- Same energy as first email
- No desperation
- No "checking in"
- Offer access, don't chase response
- Clean exit if no interest

| Outputs too long | Add strict word/character limit rule |
| Sounds formal/robotic | Add casual examples + tone rules |
| Makes up data | Rule: "Only use info from input. If not found, say 'insufficient data'" |
| Gives explanations | "Just the phrase, nothing else. No explanation" |
| Too generic | Provide more specific examples in prompt |
| Uses jargon | List banned words: leverage, optimize, streamline, synergy, etc. |

## Edge Cases
- **Client website unreachable:** Use provided description or manual research
- **<5 competitors found:** Use what's available, note in output
- **Generic industry:** Focus on process/operational pain points
- **No clear ICP:** Default to business owner/founder persona
- **No recent news/observations:** Use general industry trends or company stage

## Workflow Speed Optimization (CRITICAL for Fast Execution)

**Goal:** Reduce generation time from 5 minutes → <2 minutes

### Parallel Processing Strategy

**Phase 1: Client + Competitor Analysis (Run in Parallel)**

```
CONCURRENT OPERATIONS:
├─ WebFetch(client_url) → Extract business intel
├─ WebSearch("B2B [industry] services 2025") → Find competitors
└─ WebSearch("SDR as a service [industry] 2025") → Find more competitors
```

**Time savings:** 3 separate operations = 60s sequential → 20s parallel (3x faster)

### Phase 2: Pain Point Synthesis (Single Operation)

```
SEQUENTIAL:
└─ Analyze competitor positioning + client differentiation → Rank pain points
```

**Time:** 10-15s (cannot parallelize - requires synthesis)

### Phase 3: Copy Generation (Generate All Variants at Once)

```
CONCURRENT:
├─ Generate Variant A (Problem-Solving Connector)
├─ Generate Variant B (Movement-Based Connector)
├─ Generate Variant C (Deal-Flow Connector)
└─ Generate Variant D (Premium Signal Connector)
```

**Time savings:** 4 variants × 15s = 60s sequential → 15s parallel (4x faster)

### Phase 4: Output Creation (Single Operation)

```
SEQUENTIAL:
└─ Write markdown file with all sections
```

**Time:** 5-10s

### Total Time Comparison

**Old Sequential Workflow:**
- Client analysis: 20s
- Competitor search 1: 20s
- Competitor search 2: 20s
- Pain point synthesis: 15s
- Variant A: 15s
- Variant B: 15s
- Variant C: 15s
- Variant D: 15s
- Output file: 10s
**TOTAL: 145s (2m 25s)**

**New Parallel Workflow:**
- Phase 1 (parallel): 20s
- Phase 2 (sequential): 15s
- Phase 3 (parallel): 15s
- Phase 4 (sequential): 10s
**TOTAL: 60s (1m 0s)**

**Speed improvement: 2.4x faster**

### Implementation Notes

1. **Use concurrent WebFetch/WebSearch:** Always run multiple web operations in parallel in a single message
2. **Batch variant generation:** Generate all 4 email variants simultaneously using multiple tool calls
3. **Cache competitor data:** Store competitor analysis in `.tmp/` to avoid re-fetching for similar industries
4. **Pre-load common industries:** Maintain cached pain points for common verticals (SaaS, agencies, consultants)

### Caching Strategy for Repeated Workflows

**Cache file structure:**
```
.tmp/
├── industry_cache/
│   ├── b2b_saas_competitors.json
│   ├── agency_competitors.json
│   └── consulting_competitors.json
└── pain_point_cache/
    ├── b2b_saas_pain_points.json
    └── agency_pain_points.json
```

**When to use cache:**
- If industry matches cached data (last 7 days) → Skip competitor research
- Reduces workflow to 30-40s for repeat industries

**When to refresh cache:**
- Cache older than 7 days
- User explicitly requests fresh research
- New competitor landscape detected

## Speed Optimization Checklist

Before running workflow, verify:

- [ ] **Parallel web operations** - WebFetch + WebSearch in same message?
- [ ] **Concurrent variant generation** - All 4 variants generated simultaneously?
- [ ] **Cache check** - Industry cached in last 7 days?
- [ ] **Minimal sequential operations** - Only synthesis steps run sequentially?
- [ ] **No redundant API calls** - Reuse data from Phase 1 in Phase 3?

**Target:** 60-90s total execution time (from URL input → markdown output)
